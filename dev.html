          <h2>The Proposal</h2>
          <img src="img/proposal-frame.jpg" class="float-right" id="proposal-photo" alt="">
          <p>In March 2013, after nearly 7 years together, Caitlin and Collin traveled back to the island of Kauai, the site of their very first vacation together years ago.  Before leaving town, Collin took Caitlin's dad, Ben, out for scotch(es) to ask permission to marry his daughter.  While he had planned the proposal for quite some time, Caitlin had become suspicious.  Collin had to assure her there would absolutely not be a proposal of any kind on the trip, and stop asking.  Somehow, Caitlin accepted this, likely because she was so excited to go on a tropical vacation!</p>
          <p>And so, one morning while the time change still had them waking up before dawn, Caitlin and Collin crept down to the lava rocks over the ocean to watch the sunrise and drink Kahlua and coffee.  The air was chilly, and Caitlin quickly curled up in a towel and sat down to ponder the universe.  Through multiple awkward yet effective diversionary tactics, Collin finally convinced her to stand back up so that he could get down on one knee and propose.</p>
          <p>"Collin, do you remember what you said?"</p>
          <p>"No. Words. Words and words and ahhhh don't drop this thing in the rocks or water where we can't find it."</p>
          <p>Well, Caitlin thought it was romantic nonetheless.</p>
          <p>With the sun rising over the ocean, whales breaching in unison in the distance, and turtles swimming in the surf below, Caitlin said yes!  And after she was able to breathe again, and the tears and shaking stopped, they kissed - and lived happily ever after.</p>

        <p>This afternoon ceremony and reception will take place at the same location in Seattle's historic Pioneer Square neighborhood, right in downtown Seattle. We chose this location for a few reasons. First of all, because it is breathtaking, soulful, and perfectly sized. It is also the previous site of the Elliott Bay Bookstore, which we were both raised to love.</p>

      <div class="small-6 columns">
        <p>Now refurbished by Urban Light Studios, Axis is a killer modernized venue, but with the age and emotion of something more substantial. Look for fun touches, like the markings in the floor from when it was a fabric store, or the 'paper towel dispensers' in the bathroom. Also, while we one day look forward to having children of our own, we request that you leave your little ones at home for the night.</p>
